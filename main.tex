\section{Cognitive Neuroscience}
%%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%%
\subsection{Research Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience - prof. Christian Ruff - 20.02.2017}

There are various types of methods to acquire cognitive information. Those methods have different temporal resolution (can be acquired in milisseconds, seconds, hours, day, etc), spatial resolution (can get information of the brain, maps, columns, layers, cels, synapses, molecules) and invasiveness.

Techniques that record neuronal activity directly through electrophysiological means tend to have very good temporal resolution and techniques that manipulate brain function through drug effects or brain lesions tend to have the poorest temporal resolution.

Techniques that position electrode sensors directly within the brain have the highest spatial resolution and techniques that measure electrical signals that spread diffusely tend to have the lowest spatial resolution.

Non-invasive techniques record endogenous brain signals using sensors outside the body, thus they have almost no risk and can be conducted repeatedly in human volunteer participants. In the other hand, invasive techniques introduce a chemical or recording device into the body. Some invasive techniques can be used in humam volunteers (with significant attention) but other can be used only in human patients and/or non-human animals.

The main techniques that will be considered in this lecture are \textbf{correlative or measurement} and \textbf{causal or manipulation}. Both types of techniques provide distinct and complementary information about brain function.

Usually, the progress of cognitive neuroscience research happens quicly when measurement (correlative) techniques establish likns between brain structure and cognitive function and then manipulation (causal) techniques probe that relationtishp.

\subsubsection{Correlative techniques}

Measurements techniques measures changes in brain (information transmissionby neurons) function while a research participant (human or animal) engages in some cognitive activity. They are often described as being "correlational" because they can show that signals from a brain region co-occur with a function of interest, but they cannot show that a region is necessary for that function.

\paragraph{(f)MRI} (functional) Magnetic Resonance Imaging

MRI is a non-invasive imagin technique that employs principles of magnetic resonance to visualize different tissue types. Usually, one image is acquired. It is slow (minutes) but accurate (sub-mm spatial resolution).

The fMRI employs special sequences that are i) sensitive to blood oxygenation and ii) fast to acquire (whole brain in ~2-3 seconds). Numerous images are recorded and represent timecourse of blood oxygenation durig experimental task.

How the magnetic resonance works:
\begin{itemize}
\item Place an object (brain) in a strong \textbf{magnetic} field
\subitem protons in the body have spins with a specific orientation and frequency, when the body is inside an MRI scanner, the protons align with the direction of the magnetic field.
\item Deliver energy in form of radio waves
\subitem radio frequence pulses with the appropriate frequency (that depends on the atomic nucleus being imaged, usually\textbf{Larmor frequency}) and change the orientation of the spins as the protons absorb the energy. The frequence used is called \textbf{resonant frequency}. When the pulse is turned off, the protons return to their original orientations, this process is called "relaxation", and during the (longitudinal $\rightarrow$ T1 and transverse $\rightarrow$ T2 \ref{fig:orientation-relaxation}) relaxation, the protons emit energy in the form of radio waves.
\item Measure radio waves emitted by object
\subitem T1 is time constante of how quickly the protons realign with the magnetic field, for instance, CSF has low signal (dark) and fat has high signal (bright).
\subitem T2 is time constante of how quickly the protons emit energy when recovering to equilibrium, for instance, fat has low signal (dark) and CSF has high sinal (bright).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{imgs/mri-longitudinal-transverse.png}
  \caption{Orientation of the relaxation}
  \label{fig:orientation-relaxation}
\end{figure}

\textbf{The human scanners have a strong static magnetic field (around 1.5-7 Tesla). For reference, the earth's magnetic field is approximately 0.5 Gauss or 50-millionths of a Tesla.}

The \textbf{T1 fMRI} images are structural images with high spatial resolution ( less than 1 mm) and accurately distinguish different types of tissue. The \textbf{T2 fMRI} images have lower spatial resolution (2-3 mm) and relate changes in MR-signal to an experimental manipulation. Timeseries represents a large number of signals that are acquired in temporal order at a specific rate.

Some terminology:
\begin{itemize}
\item subjects: the item that will be scanned
\item sessions: each time that the subject is inside of the scanner
\item runs: all the images generated in one section for the whole subject. One complete scan of the subject is obtained in one single run.
\item volume: the 3d images generated from one single run
\item slices: each section of the volume is called slice.
\item voxel: each single unit information in a slice
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) contrast} measures inhomogeneities in the magnetic fiels (T2) due to changes in the level of O\textsubscript{2} in the blood. This way, fMRI measures neural activity indirectly via BOLD signal.

The oxygenated hemoglobine is diamagnetic (non magnetic) and produce no signal loss, however, the deoxygenated hemoglobine is paramagnetic (magnetic) and then produce a signal loss. When a specific region of the cortex increases its activity in response to a task, the extraction fraction of oxygen from the local capillaries leads to an initial drop in oxygenated hemoglobine (oxyHb) and an increase in local carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) and deoxygenated hemoglobine (deoxyHb). 

Some properties of the BOLD signal:
\begin{itemize}
\item peaks 4-6 seconds after neural activity (delay)
\item back to baseline after approx. 30 secs
\item can vary in precise shape between regions and subjects
\item often shows undershoot and sometimes shows initial undershoot
\end{itemize}

Due to an over-compensatory increase of rCBF( regional Cerebral Blood Flow), increased neural activity can decreases the relative amount of deoxyHB. This is called neuro-vascular coupling and it is an active area of research.

At present, the safest assumption is that BOLD relates to both spiking output and excitatory postsynaptic activity in neurons. Inhibitory activity is not assumed to lead to BOLD increases.

BOLD signal is not an absolute measure, but differs from session to session due to differences in scanner sensitivity, subject, etc. This way, BOLD signal needs to be compared between different conditions within the same experiment to infer BOLD changes (increase or decrease) due to neural process of interest P. \textbf{[Task with P] - [control task without P] = P}

For this "subtraction approach", there are assumptions of "pure insertion": i) cognitive (and neural) processes can be added to others without changing them and ii) changed behavior (and brain activity) reflects only added process.

\paragraph{Design of fMRI experiments} There advantages of fMRI are evident in its widespread acceptance among researchers and its visibility among the general public. fMRI allows us to \textbf{map complex cognitive functions in the brain of human volumteer participants with a good combination of spatial and temporal resolution}. However, fMRI has some disadvantages: it remains expensive, the scanner typicalli costs \$500-\$1000 per hour; also, some participants will be excluded based on issues related to safety (e.g., implanted devices) or comfort (e.g., claustrophobia). Moreover, even very small physiological variation (like head movements of only a few milimeters, breathing, or heartbeats) introduces noise into the BOLD signal.

they can be block-designs or event-related designs. In the block-designs, we measure constant BOLD response to a \textbf{series of stimuli}. In the event-related designs, we measure BOLD response to \textbf{each stimulus}.

Usually, fMRI experiments present a experimental stimuli displayed via MR-compatible monitor, head mounted display, or projection system, and the participant indicates his responses by moving a joystick or pressing a button.

\begin{itemize}
\item Block-designs:
\subitem higher statistical sensitivity for detecting effects.
\subitem some psychological process have to/may be better in blocks, for instance, if there is difficult to switch between states or to reduce surprise effects.
\item Event-related designs:
\subitem randomised trial order
\subitem some events can not be blocked due to stimulus context.
\end{itemize}

In the fMRI designs, the predictions for BOLD signal can be categorical (identify classes), parametric (stimuli rotating, expanding) or model-based (check correlation between some model and BOLD signals). One can use a factorial desing and combine different factors (categorical, parametric and model-based) within one study, allowing study of context-dependent neural responses (can show a failures of pure insertion).

Sometimes, the resolution of the experiment is smaller than the MR image resolution, for this, we can consider the MVPA (multivariate activity pattern) or repetition suppression instead of the univariate signal in each voxel. The MVPA assumes that the signal in each voxel represents mixture of neuronal populations specialised for different features. Note that the pattern of increases and decreases may hence reliably differentiate different stimuli, even if each voxel by itself does not. The repetition suppression... ?

\paragraph{ Analysis of fMRI experiments: SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) } it is a statistical approach instantiated in the most widely used software package for fMRI anaysis, it is implemented in MATLAB and it is open source. Allows standardised detection of \textbf{regional activity changes} in each voxel, associated with task parameters.

\begin{itemize}
\item Preprocessing
\subitem Realignment (= registration): fix small head movements, assumes that the shape of the brain does not change.
\subitem Spatial Normalisation: increase sensitivity with more subjects, extrapolate findings to the whole population and make results from different studies comparable (all in the same 'coordinate system')
\subitem Smoothing: increase signal to noise, improve inter-subject averaging. In SPM, smoothing is a convolution with a Gaussian kernel. After smoothing, each voxel becomes the result of applying a weighted region of interest.
\item Model estimation
\subitem parameters estimation from GLM of voxel timeseries
\item Contrasts and SPMs
\subitem statistical inference
\end{itemize}

The results from fMRI are presented usually in three diferent ways, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fMRI-results}. More specifically:
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/fMRI-results.png}
  \caption{Common ways to present fMRI results. A) maps of activation, B) time courses of BOLD fMRI signal and C) parameter estimates of fMRI activation.}
  \label{fig:fMRI-results}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Maps of activation
\subitem the image is not a snapshot of the brain activity or a map of brain function. It simply indicates the results of a particular set of statistical tests, and the threshold for significance is (usually) corrected by the number of tests conducted.
\item Time course of activation
\subitem it shows the BOLD contrast MR signal changed over the duration of the experiment. The pattern of changes in BOLD signal over time is called a hemodynamic response.
\item Parameter estimates
\subitem This involves creating a hypothesized model for the changes in brain activation that would be observed if there was an effect of the experimental condition. Its main advantage is that it provides a hypothesis-based statistical framework that can be adapted to any experimental design.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Advances in fMRI}
Contrary to popular conception, advances in MRI technology have not been through stronger scanners, intead, the advances are changes in the hardware and procedures dor collecting fast and high-signal images. Rather than only recording signals from a single sensor around the sample object, new multi-channel scanners record MR signals from a large number of sensors at different points in space.

\subsubsection{Causal Techniques}
In order to address the impact of neural processes on behavior, neuroscients have developed several reserch thechniques to experimentally manipulate neural processing in specific brain areas. Causal or manipulation techniques examine how perturbations of the brain’s function change cognitive functions or behavior. Pertubations on brain can be achieved either by transiently changing neuronal firing rates or neurotransmitter levels (\textbf{brain stimulation techniques}) or by permanently damaging tissue (\textbf{techniques that study the consequences of brain lesions}). Actually, there is a third technique: \textbf{neurophamacological intervetion}.

\paragraph{Brain Stimulation Techniques} Communication between connected neurons depends on the flow of electric charges. Neurons maintain an electric potential of about -70mV and when this potential rises above a fixed threshold voltage-gated ion channels open and trigger action potentials. This variation on membrane potential is usually caused by synaptic input from other neurons, but an external electrical current can also affect membrane voltages and thus generate or inhibit action potentials. Brain Stimulation Techniques produce electrical currents in the brain in a controlled and locally specific fashion.

\paragraph{History of causal techniques: invasive stimulation} Fritsch \& Hitzig in 1870 electrically stimulated an awake dog's brain via inserted wires and caused involuntary movements. The experiments were done in Frisch's home as the University would not allow the experiments. It was the first study to show that externally supplied electricity triggers neural function. Penfield and Rasmussen in 1950 attached electrodes to the cortical surface of human patients who were about to undergo neurosurgery and applied electrical current at various parts of the cerebral cortex. The behaviors and sensations elicited by stimulation of each area were documented in one of the first empirical maps of various motor, sensory and cognitive functions in the human cortex \textbf{Systematic "cartography" of brain-behavior (homunculus)}.\\

Nowadays, direct electrical stimulation of neurons via intracranial electrodes remains a routine technique in animal research, but most neuroscients use non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in human research as these techniques do not require surgery and can thus be employed routinely in health participants.

\paragraph{Causal Methods: Non-invasive stimulation} overcome need for invasive pre-surgical diagnosis, allow systematic testing of excitability and integrity of motor tracts, modulate function of the cortex for clinical purposes. Examples: TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and tES (transcranial electric stimulation).

\paragraph{TMS}

\paragraph{TMS: Biophysics} From Faraday's Law: a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field in a conducting material. The induced electric field results in a measurable voltage and current flow. For TMS, the conducting material is the brain and the induced current activates neurons, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tms}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imgs/tms.png}
  \caption{Basic principle of TMS}
  \label{fig:tms}
\end{figure}

Brain is not homogenous conductor, but mixture of different materials (skull, liquor,
gray and white matter) that have different conductivities. So, how does the electric field affect neurons?

\begin{itemize}
\item Activation of nerve fibre determined by the spatial derivative of the field component parallel to the fibre (the activating function)
\item Nerve bends are low-threshold points and therefore easiest to stimulate; the stronger the field, the stronger the stimulation.
\item Cortical neurons have numerous bends, terminals and branches; these will all be affected most at the location where the induced fiels is maximal.
\item The likely stimulation point in the cortex for random orientation of bends etc, is the field maximum.
\end{itemize}

TMS stimulates neurons by means of electromagnetic induction. By placing a looped copper coil against the part of the scalp overlying the site to be stimulated and running a strong, rapidly changing electrical current through the coil we generate a magnetic pulse perpendicular to the coil that permeates the skull and brain tissue. The rapid change of the magnetic pulse generates a complementary electric field in any conductive material (in this case, the neural tissue). \textbf{In other words, TMS uses a magnetic field, which can pass easily through the skull, to generate an electrical field inside  the skull.} The likelihood that an action potential will be generated at any location depends on the orientation of these neurons with regard to the induced electrial field, this means, \textbf{some locations in the cortex are easier to stimulate than others using this technique}.

The two most common coil shapes are circular and figure-eight-shaped. Circular coils generate powerful but more difuse fields, whereas figure-eight coils result in more focal fields that produce the maximum current at the intersection of the two windings.

\paragraph{TMS: Neurophysiology and types of stimulation protocols} TMS pulses of hand representation in M1 (motor cortex area 1) cause measurable twitches in hand muscles. Non-motor cortical areas require different behavioral indices.

\textbf{Finding the right area} The first step of any TMS experiment involves localizing the scalp area overlying the cortical area that is to be stimulated. The experimenter needs to estimate where on the scalp the TMS coil needs to be placed in order to induce currents in the target area. The stimulation area can also be identified as the site at which TMS has maximal behavioral effects in a separated task performed before the actual experiment begins.

\textbf{Finding the optimal TMS intensity} The optimal TMS intensity is usually determined for each participant individually as a fixed percentage of the motor threshold (MT), that is, the minimum intensity at which TMS applied over the motor cortex elicits hand twiches.

\textbf{Influencing brain activity} There are at least two different ways to influence brain activity. 
\begin{itemize}
\item repeated TMS (rTMS) pulses can be applied \textit{online} during task performance at a temportal frequency (5-20 Hz).
\subitem The rTMS pulses elicit unspecific neural activity in the targeted area that disrupts cortical computations at that location.
\item rTMS can also be applied just prior to the task (\textit{offline}). The offline TMS generates after-effects offering a window in which the normal functional contribution of the stimulated area and possibly interconected areas are markedly reduced.
\subitem rTMS can be applied for several minutes at low temporal frequency (1 Hz) $\rightarrow$ can reduce Motor Evoked Potentials for roughly the same duration as the length of rTMS application
\subitem rTMS can be applied for less than a minute in a \textit{theta burst pattern}, tipically 3-5 pulses at 100 Hz repeated at 5Hz. Theta-burst TMS (TBS) mimicks the theta rhythm that is expressed during memory storage. Also, TBS has been shown to lead to reductions (for continuous TBS) or enhancements (for intermittent TBS) of Motor Evoked Potential size lasting more than 30 minutes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{From slides notes:} It is necessary to be sure that the brain area is "at rest" during the stimulation (voluntary movements/contraction can reverse/abolishes the effects.

\paragraph{Advantages and Limitations of TMS} TMS allows non-invasive manipulation of neural processing with high spatial resolution (about one centimeter) and exceptional temporal resolution (milliseconds). However, nowadays it is only possible to target brain areas on the cortical surface. Also, for offline studies, there is some uncertainty about the precise duration of time window of TMS after-effects during which behavioral tests can be conducted.

\paragraph{tES: Biophysics} Two poles with electric potential difference (charge) connected through a conductive medium. The connection leads to discharge by electric current: negatively charged ions (anions) flow to anode and positively charged ions (cathions) flow to cathode, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tes}. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{imgs/tes.png}
  \caption{Basic principle of tES}
  \label{fig:tes}
\end{figure}

tES envolves attaching two electrodes to the scalp and applying a constant electric potential difference, thus running a weak but constant electrical current between them. This affects the neurons along the path of the current, slightly changing their membrane voltages and thus their spontaneous firing. These effects are strongest directly beneath the electrodes where the current density is highest.

\textbf{About 50\% of the applied current reaches the cortex, the rest is shunted by the skull.}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Differences between TMS and tES}
\end{table}

\paragraph{History of causal techniques: lesion studies } Investigates causal brain-behavior relations (consequence of focal head wounds). They are measure in hypothesis-guided fashion cognitive and behavioral deficits of brain-lesioned patients.

Brain lesions in animals can also be experimentally induced in the laboratory, which enables scientists to test anatomically specific hypotheses about the relevance of the brain areas for specific behaviors.

\paragraph{Lesion studies in humans} The studiy of behavioral deficits in patients with brain damage (refered to as \textbf{neuropsychology}) originated in the neurological clinic.

One of the greatest challenges in neurological research is thus to determine the exact scope and extent of the neural damage associated with the given condition.

To test a hypothesis about the functional role of a given brain area using the lesion approach, researchers first identify a group of patients with more or less selective damage to that brain area. It is necessary, also, to identify a suitable control group for behavioral comparison (the control participants need to be closely matched to the patients with respecto to behaviorally relevant factors such as age, intelligence, socioeconomic status, cultural background, etc.

\paragraph{Advantages} The brain-behavior relationship is truly causal. Behavior deficits due to brain lesion can be very profound and can be evident to untrained observers. Moreover, the behavioral deficits resulting from naturally occurring brain damage can be very unexpected, leading to entirely new hypothesis. The knowledge gained from lesion studies is always relevant for medical care as it specifies behavioral deficits in patientes with specific types of brain damage, which may help the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

\paragraph{Limitations} Brain damage is often spatially diffuse, this can make it very difficult to find patients with overlapping damage in the structures of interest. Often litle is known about patients' behavior prior to the accident or illness. Brain injuries and ilnesses and their treatment can have nonspecific sequelae that may affect behavior, such as brain reorganization, medication effects, or an altered life situation.

\paragraph{Lesion studies in animals} In animals lesions are generated in clearly defined brain regions by various means so that therapeutic measures and the time course of recovery can be studied. A surgery is performed to produce a lesion at the designated site, usually the damage is irreversible.

Lesion experiments in animasl usually involve an experimental and a control group of animals that undergo matched procedures to rule out any unspecific effects of training, surgery, etc. The control group also undergoes surgery, but the procedures do not involve harm to the brain. At the end of testing, the extent of the lesion is documented by detailed \textit{post morten} neuroanatomical and neurochemical examination of the brain tissue.

\paragraph{Advantages} Full control over many variables that vary randomly in the context of pathological brain lesion in humans. Animals can be randomly assigned to either lesion or control group and can be perfectly matched in terms of experience, life situation, etc.

\paragraph{Limitations} Difficult to conduct: the training and keeping of experimental animals can be very labor-intensive and costly and surgery and behavioral testing require considerable infrastructure. It is generally difficult to compare behavior across species.

\subsection{Perception and Attention - prof. D. Kiper - 27.02.2017}

\subsubsection{Perception}
Perception is \textbf{not a passive process} (sensation is the passive process). Perception is \textbf{the process by which people select, organize, interpret and respond to information from the world around them}. It is selection and organization of environmental stimuli to provide meaningful experiences (we are not passive analyzers). The particular perception of itself is called proprioception. If you do not receive any stimulus (for instance, in a depravation tank), your brain creates it.

\textbf{Perception is essentially the interface between the outer and inner worlds.} The outer environment creates signals that can be sensed and the perceiver receives these signals and converts them into psychologically meaningful representations that define our inner experience of the world.

The perceptual process consists of six stages (Figure \ref{fig:perception-stages}):

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/perception-stages.png}
  \caption{Stages of perception}
  \label{fig:perception-stages}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item (1-2) People receive stimuli from the enviroment throught their senses.
\item (3) When the senses are activated, starts the perceptual selection. The perceptual selection is a filter, that allow us to deal with the most important matter. This is called \textbf{selective screening}: our system eliminates some factors because they are not important for us to be aware of. The "most important" is based on influencing factors that can be external or internal, as listed in Table \ref{table:factors-perception}.
\item (4) When the most important stimuli is identified, starts the perceptual organization process by which people group the stimuli in recognizable patterns, listed in Table  \ref{table:perceptual-organization}.
\item (5-6) Then, we use the information received to interpret and respond to the stimuli. Perception is noisy and makes mistakes, it is a very complex system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ p{13cm} |  p{2cm} }
    \hline
    Internal & External \\ \hline
    personality -  strong factor & size \\ \hline
    learning and perceptual sets - expectation of particular interpretation based on past experiences with the same or similar objects & intensity \\ \hline
    motivation - the needs and desires at any particular time can influence perception (when you are hungry you can perceive a food as more delicious than when you are not hungry) & contrast \\ \hline
	 & motion \\ \hline
 	 & repetition \\ \hline
 	 & novelty \\ \hline
     & familiarity \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Externals and internal influencing perception}
  \label{table:factors-perception}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ l |  p{12.5cm} }
    \hline
    perceptual grouping or continuity & lines are seen as following the smoothest path \\ \hline
    closure & tendency to complete an object and perceive it as a constant \\ \hline
    color constancy & your brain starts to iluminate the enviroment making you think the color is the same in different enviroments \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of perceptual organization}
  \label{table:perceptual-organization}
\end{table}

The most common types of perceptual errors are:
\begin{itemize}
\item accuracy in judgment (main types listed in Table \ref{table:accuracy-judgment}).
\item perceptual defence: the tendency for people to protect themselves agains ideas, objects or situations thar are threatening.
\item stereotyping: the belief that all members of a specific group share similar traits and behaviors.
\item halo effect: tendency to color everthing we know about a person because of one recognizable (un)favourable trait.
\item projection: tendenct to see one's trait in others.
\item role of culture: culture influence our perception in selecting information and exhibiting a behavioral pattern in situations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ p{5cm} |  p{10cm} }
    \hline
    similarity error & assuming that people are similar to us and then, will behave like us \\ \hline
    contrast error & comparing people to others rather than to some absolut standard \\ \hline
    overweighting of negative information & tendency to overreact to something negative \\ \hline
    race, age, and gender bias & tendency to be more or less positive based on one's race, age or sex \\ \hline
	first impression error & forming first impressions that are resistant to change \\ 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Examples of perceptual organization}
  \label{table:accuracy-judgment}
\end{table}

This simple perception-appraisal-response sequence is implemented innumerable times in the course of any given day and, to a great extent, is completed without effort.

\subsubsection{Attention}
Attention is taking possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what sem several simultaneous possible objects or trains of thought. It is the focalization, concentration of consciouness. It implies withdraw from some things in order to deal effectively with others.

Attention can change rapidly, switching from one thing to another. It can be steered by our intentions ("top-down"), as when we look for a particular face in a crowd, or it
can be steered by features of objects in the world ("bottom-up"), as when our attention is grabbed by a police car's flashing lights in our rearview mirror.

The bottom-up stimulus usually seems to require immediate behavioral responses (e.g, a rock flying in your direction). It seems quite functional that the attentional system is tuned to attend quickly to moving and looming stimuli as those stimuli will commonly have more immediate survival implications than the more stable ones.

Not all stimuli in the perceptual fiel receive equal attention; instead, some stimuli are selected for relatively intense scrutinity, making them more likely to reach the threshold of awareness. When an individual encounters stereotype-inconsistent information, attention is drawn, and the perceptual details of an event are encoded.

We can enhance perception, if we focus our attention on a location in the visual field, this is called \textbf{spotlight of attention}. However, enhancing perception in one part of the visual field takes place at the expense of other areas.

\textbf{Shadowing task} is an experiment where two "signs" are presented to the participant and one of the signs will "hide" the other.

There are three main types of attention: overt, covert and feature attention. Each one of them are explained in Table \ref{table:types-attention}. The common area for saccade eye movements (overt attention) and covert attention is the frontal lobe; the area preferentially activated by covert attention is the parieral lobe.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ p{5cm} |  p{10cm} }
    \hline
    overt attention & selectively attending to an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction \\ \hline
    covert attention & related with spotlight of attention, you can't pay attention to many things, this way when you pay attention in one thing, your capacity to pay attention in others decay. \\ \hline
    feature attention & shadowing tasks, we can distinguish two mixed texts by focusing our attention on cues such as type style \\ 
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Types of attention}
  \label{table:types-attention}
\end{table}

There are two orienting mechanisms: \textbf{exogenous or reflexive} and \textbf{endogenous or voluntary}. Table \ref{table:orienting-mechanisms} list the main differences between them.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{ p{8cm} |  p{8cm} }
    \hline
    exogenous & endogenous \\ \hline
	\hline

\paragraph{Broadbent's filter theory - early selection} Broadbent (1958) argued that information from all of the stimuli presented at any given time enters a sensory buffer.  One of the inputs is then selected on the basis of its physical characteristics for further processing by being allowed to pass through a filter, all the others are lost.  Broadbent assumed that the filter rejected the non-shadowed or unattended message at an early stage of processing. It takes time to shift attention.

\paragraph{Deutsch and Deutsch theory - late selection} All information get through but attention filters only act after meaning is analyzed, for example, each ear receives a different message and it is asked to the participant to say the message. The message can be recovered if it is the only thing with meaning.

\paragraph{Treisman's theory - attenuation} physical characteristics are used to select one information for full processing but other messages are given partial processing. 

Early or late experiments: Treisman and Geffen (1967) set about to test whether the filter was early or late in the processing stream. They had subjects shadow a message on one ear, and tap whenever they heard a certain word in either ear. When the key word appeared in the attended ear, subjects tapped 87\% of the time, but when the key word appeared in the unattended ear, subjects tapped 8\% of the time. This indicates that early selection is occurring.

A lot of simple experiments can be made to evaluate attention, for instance, pop out. It is easy to "find" elements based on one feature, more features (conjunction) will take longer to find the elements. \textbf{pop out experiments can prove sinestesia because one can use one specific feature such as color, to find elements easily}. The more popout, more later selection (selection after meaning). Popout can be trained!

\paragraph{Another definition of attention} Attention is what enables us to process information about the world around us. We can only be aware of things around us if we pay attention to them. \textbf{Preattentive} processes help us decide what to pay attention to and waht to filter out and ignore.

\paragraph{Effects in early visual cortex} Desimone experiments. MTA (medial temporal area) $\rightarrow$ prefered direction of motion $\uparrow$. Attention is like a weight to fire particular neurons.

\paragraph{Selective and divided attention} Attention is studied by presenting participants with two or more stimuli at the same time, this is called dual-task performance. In selective (focused) attention tasks, people are instructed to respond to one input only. In divided attention tasks, people are asked to process and respond to more than one input.

\subsection{Body Perception - 27.03.2017}
\subsubsection{Phantomology}
Phantomology (is the name of the second chapter of Summa Technolofiae - 1964) and defines it as the science of the virtual reality of the body.
"The science of the body in the brain, from out-of-limb to out-of-body experiences. 
Phantom  limb  sensation refers to the persistent experience of the postural and motor aspects of a limb after its physical loss.
\begin{itemize}
\item phantom body parts: the feeling of the body part after the removal of the body part
\item hemiphantom: the feeling that half of the body is an entity that has its own life
\item phantom double: the feeling of have a second body that imitates the original one.
\item out of body experiences: the feeling of be disconnected with its own body.
\end{itemize}

The phantom limb is studied since 1510 (Paré) but the term "phantom limb" is from 1829 (Mitchell).

\paragraph{to read:} Finger and thustwitt, 2003, Neurosurgery 52.

\textbf{Sensation is in the brain, not in the limb - Descartes}

Even adult brains are capable to reorganize itself. In one experiment with adult monkeys, the cortical plasticity was identified: the monkeys lose a finger and the neighbors fingers took the "empty" area of the finger on the brain.
In the maladaptive model, the pain is the price for the plasticity, the loss of input generates a "invasion" that causes pain. 
In the maintained representation model, the pain generates an increased input and then it is maintained the neural representation, in Nature 2013, an article was published saying that phantom pain is associated with preserved structure and function in the former area (fMRI activation on phantom hand movement).

It is not very clear what is guided by phantom limb and why some people feel phantom limb pain. It is the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system that origin the phantom limb sensation?

\paragraph{Phantomology} there are two types of phantom body parts: after amputation and also in congenital limb deficiency.
Phantom limb can be feel even in congenital limb experiencies. Three main explanations: i) projection of enhanced motility of finger rudiments; ii) based on contralateral representation of intact limb; iii) based on innate schema for hand-mouth coordination. 
One patient has been feeling, as long as she can remember, a complete body. And she gets aware of hands in reflex movements and uses them to gesture. Also, she reports preference in posture (for instance in folding her arms) and says the inverted posture feels "awckward".
 
Scientific fact: does not mean remembering is not important, also does not mean "body schema" is "inate".

\paragraph{Negative phantom limbs} it happens when there is a physical limb but there is no "connection", the person do not recognize the existence of the body part, also called xenomelia.

One neglected phenomenal aspect of phantom limbs is the obstacle shunning: put a physical object at the same place as the phantom body part. Approximately 50\% believes the phantom limb is still there even when a pile of books is placed at the same location of the limb, the others 50\% perceive that the phantom limb is in his/her head. Experiment: ask for a person with phantom limb sensation to point out the location of the phantom body part, and then, add a physical object to the same place. The phantom body part vanishes but the phantom pain remains. \textbf{Even if the phantom limb sensations disappears the phantom limb pain can still holds} In some cases, the confrotation of the phantom limb with solid matter makes the person change the postural body as if the phantom limb changed its place. Also, there are cases where the kind of matter that is taking the place of the phantom limb matters. For instance, in one experiment with a man who lose the anterior part of his right foot, if he put his foot really close to a wall or other objects, the phantom sensation was there (but with the toes in different position), however, when the man put his foot behind his left foot, the sensation was different (as if the toes retracted into the foot).

To move the feet from an obstacle, if we do it in a fast way (brief interstimulus intervals) the foot appears to pass through the object. However, if we do it with longer interstimulus intervals, the foot appears to go around the object.
Amputees with shunning show the long apparent motion trajectory with shorter interstimulus intervals. Shunning is associated with worse prothesis tolerance.

The phantom limb studies is relevant in research because the individual differences in visual-somesthetic interactions, but also has a clinical relevance considering the adjustment to a protesis.

\paragraph{Phantom limb without amputation} also called spinal phantom limb. The main difference to amputation phantom is the visual observation of dysfunctional but still present limbs. 

\paragraph{supernumary} is a condition where the affected individual believes and receives sensory information from limbs of the body that do not actually exist, and never have existed. One of the patients have the sense of arms protruding from chest. Every time the patient tried to "slip into the phantom limb", she reports that the phantoms are evade laterally.

You do not need to physically lose a limb to experience phantom limb. Without the visual system we can simulate the feeling of phantom limb. 
Experiment 1: Pinocchio-illusion - with closed eyes, participant touch his/her nose, biceps is stimulated. Participants perceive arm or/and nose in different location.
Experiment 2: Rubber hand - Place the rubber hand on a table in front of you and conceal your real hand behind a cardboard. A second person will, using identical movements, do the same thing with your hand and the fake hand. After a while, participants are convinced that the fake hand is their own hand.

\subsection{All Question - topics}

\subsubsection{Methods}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{ fMRI is routinely used to study the neural processes underlying behavior. Please describe all the procedures necessary for conducting and correctly interpreting an fMRI study, covering the following areas:}
fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a non invasive technique that employs principles of magnetic resonance that are sensitive to blood oxygenation and are fast to acquire.

\subparagraph{Data acquisition (what signals are measured in fMRI, and how?)}
To acquire data it is necessary follow three steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Place an object (brain) in a strong magnetic field: protons in the body have spins with a specific orientation and frequency. When the body is inside an MRI scanner, the protons align with the direction of the magnetic field.
\item Apply radio waves: radio frequences pulses with the appropriate frequence (Larmor frequency) change the orientation of the spins as the protons absorb the energy. When the pulse is turned off, the protons return to their original orientations (this process is called relaxation), and during relaxation the protons emit energy in the form of radio waves.
\item Measure radio waves emitted by the object (brain):  two measures can be acquired - T1 longitudinal and T2 transverse. T1 is how quicly the protons realign with the magnetic field and accurately distinguish different types of tissue, T2 is how quicly the protons emit energy when recovering equilibrium and relate changes in MR-signal to an experimental manipulation.
\end{enumerate}

One of the most commons signal used to relate changes in the MR-signal to the experimental manipulation is the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) signal. This signal measures inhomogeneities in the magnetic field (T2) due to changes in the level of O\textsubscript{2} in the blood. This way, fMRI measures neural activity indirectly. The oxygenated blood is non magnetic while the deoxygenated blood is magnetic. When a specific region of the cortex increases its activity in response to a task, this region consumes the oxygen leading to an initial drop in oxygenated hemoglobine and an increase in local carbon dioxide and deoxygenated hemoglobine.

\subparagraph{Data analysis (which sequential routines are necessary to detect signal changes in fMRI images, using software packages such as SPM?)}
The data analysis using software such as SPM allows standardised detection of activity changes in each voxel, and for this three macro steps are necessary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preprocessing: in the preprocessing phase we can realign the images to fix small head movements, normalise the data to increase sensitivity with more subjects, to extrapolate findings to the whole population, to make the results comparable among different studies, also, we can smooth the image to increase signal to noise, impreve inter-subject average.
\item Model estimation: calculate parameter for instance, from GLM of voxel timeseries.
\item Contrasts and SPM: do the statistical inference.
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Results interpretation (what inferences about neuronal activity can be drawn from fMRI results?}
The fMRI results (using BOLD signal) are not an absolut measure, the results can differ from session to session due to differences in the scanner, in the subject, etc. This way, BOLD signals need to be compared between different conditions within the same experiment to infer BOLD changes, for example, we acquire signal for the task P and also signals from a control withou the task P. The difference between the two acquisition will be the result of the task P. This is an approach that assumes a "pure insertion" theory, where cognitive (and neural) process can be added to others withou changing them and the change in behavior (and in brain activity) reflects only the added process. Also, the fMRI results are correlative results, i.e., they can show that signals from a brain region co-occur with a task of interest but cannot show that a region is necessary for that function.

\item \paragraph{What are the physiological correlations of fMRI signal? How does the fMRI signals correlate with neuronal activities?}

The physical correlation of fMRI is neural activity, resulting in an initial (about 0.5-2s) ‘undershoot’ of the proportion of oxygenated hemoglobin, due to the consumption of oxygen for the neural activity. This leads to a reduction of the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependant) signal. Neural activity seems to mediate vasodilation (maybe through to release of NO), leading to an increase of blood flow (after 2-10s), resulting in an increase of the BOLD signal due to the better blood supply. Studies comparing BOLD data with EEG data have shown that the BOLD signal rather reflects the information uptake and processing by neurons than their spiking output measured by EEG.

\subsubsection{Memory}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Please list the different types of long-term memory you know of. Describe their properties in humans, group them according to involved brain structures and give examples of behavioral tests that allow to model these memory types in rodents}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sleep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Sleep regulation in physiological short and long sleepers: Explain the most important principles how sleep and wakefulness are physiologically regulated and how sleep-wake regulation may differ between habitual short and long sleepers.}

\item \paragraph{Characteristics of sleep in mammals: Do they apply to invertebrates?}
behavioural:
Sleeping site 
Quiescence
Body posture
Elevated arousal threshold
Rapid state reversibility
Physiological:
Altered EEG
Reduced muscle tone
Reduced heart rate
Reduced respiration
Reduced body temperature
Regulatory:
Compensatory response to sleep deficit or excess sleep

\item \paragraph{Non-REM-REM sleep}

REM: rapid eye movement. EEG low amplitude, mixed frequency (more similar to wake than to deep sleep EEG). Most prominent in the morning hours.
non-REM: is subdivided into four substages 1-4 in human, deep sleep consists of stages 3 and 4. In deep sleep, he EEG contains prominent slow waves (0.5-4.5 Hz, high amplitude).
cycles: REM sleep occurs every 90-100 mins during sleep (ultradian oscillator origins in the Pons). General term to describe cyclic alternation between REM and non-REM sleep. Healthy people usually start with stage 1, then 2, 3, 4, 2, REM, 2, 3, 4, REM etc.

\item \paragraph{Sleep homeostasis and marker of sleep homeostasis on the sleep EEG}

homeostasis has been defined as the coordinated physiological processes wich maintain most of the steady states in the organism; sleep homeostasis refers to the sleep need in dependance of the time spent awake. Sleep need rises exponentially during wake and declines exponentially during sleep. According to 2-process model of sleep regulation, sleep need is additionally dependant on circadian time.
	NREM-sleep is controlled thalamocortically.
        	Marker of sleep homeostasis: slow-wave activity (power of slow waves rises in recovery sleep after sleep deprivation according to the 2-process model)

\item \paragraph{Endogenous sleep-promoting components: comments}

SCN (superchiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus)
	clock genes: transcriptional/translational process
	melatonin: built during sleep
	Thalamus: control of NREM-sleep
	Pons: Regulation of REM-sleep
	Potential homeostatic sleep-promoting agents (Experiment: if CSF from a sleep-deprived animal is transferred to a rested animal, the rested animal becomes tired $\rightarrow$ there must be an agent in the CSF that accumulates during wakefulness and makes tired): adenosine, Interleukin-1b, TNFa, GHRH, prostaglandin.

\item \paragraph{Role of thalamus-correlated rhythm in sleep: comments}

Thalamus controls the NREM sleep rhythmus $\rightarrow$ EEG activation / desactivation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Schizophrenia}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Please describe shortly a neurobiological model of schizophrenia}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Depression}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Please describe briefly:} \subparagraph{Some conceptional problems in studying depression from a neuroscientific point of view} 

Depression is a disorder of subjective feeling (translation from first person perspective to third person perspective: epistemic problem). It is very difficult to evaluate the disease scientifically (animal models that are really adequate to depression, they can’t talk to tell their feelings). The definition of psychiatry depends on social values and personal evaluation of suffering, but not depends on the organic disorder. No reliable bjective markers like genetic defects or metabolic disfunctions.

\subparagraph{Some changes of the neurobiology system in a depression state}
Change of HPA-axis (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal)
	The prominent mechanism by which the brain reacts to acute and chronic stress is the activation of HPA-axis $\rightarrow$ cortisol levels rise.
		Hypothalamus secretes CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormon) $\rightarrow$ pituitary (hypophysis) secrets adrenalcorticotropin (ACTH) $\rightarrow$ adrenal gland secrets cortisol

Growth hormone is reduced.
	Sleep disorders (EEG!), disturbances of appetite regulation.

different activation of brain areas (activation of medioorbital cortex and ventral anterior cingulate $\rightarrow$ limbic system activated)

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Psychiatric disorders - general}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Animal models of behaviour allow us to investigate the symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Discuss statements, giving examples of some specific model}

You always have to ensure that the animal model is valid. There are different aspects of validity that have to be guaranteed:
Face validity: quantifiable behavior and physiology in the animal model have to be similar to the symptoms in the investigated human illness.
Construct validity: the quantifiable behavior and physiology in the animal model must be a result of the same central state as in the human patient. Theoretical rationale.
Predictive validity: close correspondence between drug actions on behavior and physiology of the animal model and the human patient.
Inter-laboratory validity
Inter-species validity

 Schizophrenia:
Impairment of working memory leads to symptoms like halluzinations: lack of references against associative memories.
	Selective attention is impaired, leading to delusions (misinterpretations), confusion of external and internal stimuli and retreatment to safety (neg. symptoms). 
Specific test: Latent Inhibition (LI) test. LI paradigm: repeated non-reinforced pre-exposure to a stimulus retards subsequent conditioning to that stimulus. This reflects the ability of ‘learning not to attend’. In animals: rats reduce LI when given amphetamine $\rightarrow$ animal model for schizophrenia. Rats that get amphetamine, avoid the box where they got shocked previously in the CAR (conditioned avoidance response) and reduce licking water in the CER (conditioned emotional response) tests compared to control animals due to their impaired LI.


	Depression:
	Animal model of learned helplessness: animals are exposed to negative stimuli and don’t get the possibility to escape. This leads to the ‘learned helplessness’ symptom, especially, if the animals are very young, which means, they give up very quickly and are not able to escape unwanted situations. Learned helplessness can be measured by the escape behavior in a two-way avoidance test. In this test, animals are placed in a shuttle box and exposed to a foot shock. They are allowed to escape to the save compartment of the shuttle box. If they get conditioned for the shock with a tone, starting shortly before the shock, animals learn to escape already at the presentation of the tone. ‘Helpless’ animals are not good in escaping compared to controls.
	Chronic mild stress: Animals are chronically exposed to mild stress like food / water deprivation for some hours, not enough space, over night illumination etc. The loss of pleasure (anhedonia) is measured with the ICSS (intra-cranial self-stimulation), the PRS (progressive reward schedule) or the sucrose preference test.
	Early life stress: Pups are stressed by separating them from mother for several hours per day etc.$\rightarrow$ anhedonia

\item \paragraph{Describe methods for measuring motivation, attention and memory in rodents and/or primates. In which neuropsychiatric disease are these beavioural processes disrupted?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Circadian Rhythm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Circadian pacemakers, entrainment, Zeitgeber, phas-response curve}

Pacemaker: SCN (superchiasmatic nucleus of hypothalamus)
	entrainment means that the ‘inner clock’, located in the SCN, is flexible in the way that it can adapt the phase (example: time-zone flights) and the frequency (example: bunker experiments, where one ‘day’ lasts 25 hours) of the circadian clock.
	Entrainment: via light, signalling from the eye to the SCN (possible photoreceptor: Melanopsin?). In the SCN, per transcription is activated upon light signal.
Phase-response curve: depending on the circadian time, when a light pulse is presented, the phase of the circadian clock is shifted forward or backward. If the light pulse is presented shortly before the active period has started, then the phase is advanced and if the pulse is given shortly after the active period has ended, the phase is delayed (in humans). There is one time point during night when the phase shift swiches from delayed to advanced.

\item \paragraph{Which physiological and endocrine variables in human are frequently used a phase-marker of circadian rhythm}

endocrine: melatonin, adrenal gland (adrenalin, cortison); GHRH (Growth hormone releasing hormon)
	Physiological: body temperature; activity (via activity monitor); alpha-activity in the waking EEG

\item \paragraph{What is the evidence that SCN is a circadian pacemaker}

lesion method $\rightarrow$ arythmicity
         in vitro culture of a single SCN neuron    
         SCN transplant reserves the rhythm
         in vitro SCN

\item \paragraph{Which genes (gene?) are (is) involvedin generation of circadian rhythm}

in mammals: Bmal1 is rhythmically expressed by the SCN. Clock and bmal1(basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family) build heterodimers. These heterodimers bind to E-boxes of enhancers of the per and cry gene. Per and Cry proteins dimerize outside the nucleus and are phosphorylated. The dimers re-enter the nucleus and downregulate transcription of  clock and bmal1 (negative feedback-loop). Situation is even more complex, also containing positive feedback-loops…)
        in fruit fly Cyc/Clk heterodimers activate per/tim gene transcription. Negative feedback-loop: Per/Tim heterodimers inhibit activation of their own genes via Cyc/Clk.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Models of Computation (?) $\rightarrow$ this topic was not covered in 2017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \paragraph{Roles of automate as models for computation}

The computational process in neurons can be investigated in neuroinformatics via   automate models (as   compared to the structural process via neuroscience)

\item \paragraph{Automate suitable models for describing the operation of neurons and networks of neurons}

Models for automates are transferable to neurons / neuronal networks:

	Feedforward processor: input $\rightarrow$ blackbox $\rightarrow$ output (without memory)
	In neuron: input correlates to the dentritic input (sum of input signals x weights), output correlates to the axonal output (fire or not fire)

	Finite State Machine: input $\rightarrow$ black-box (which remembers the state in which it is, memory!) $\rightarrow$ output
	In neuron: neurons also can feed back information to build up memory (this model accounts only for short-time memory (seconds)…). Feedback occurs, when axonal output is networked to dendrites of the very same neuron.

	Turing Machine: input $\rightarrow$ black-box containing unbounded memory $\rightarrow$ output
	Church-Turing-Thesis: this machine is able to compute all possible computations. Philosophic question: is the brain’s memory unbounded???
	
	Universal Turing Machine: can simulate the computational process of any Turing Machine, when it knows the protocol of this machine, thus it can also simulate the computational process of a neuron… But the protocol is not known (e.g.: a bee can do computations leading to very various and complex behavior, there is no computational model that could do that with the limited recourses of a few thousand neurons that a bee needs to accomplish it)

	But: Neuronal networks have different weights for the 10 exp 14 axons/dentrite connections. This is not possible to be determined genetically (not enough resources), but dependant on the microenvironment of each neuron in the developmental process. Moreover, they can adapt to the environment by changing those weights or even establishing new connections between axons and dentrites.
	Synaptic release is additionally very versatile, can be modulated chemically, and be inhibitory or excitatory etc.
